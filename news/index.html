Nov 23 I have given a Keynote at Thailand’s first Earthquake Engineering Conference organised by the newly formed EARTH centre . A very important initiative to raise the profile of earthquake engineering in Thailand.

Thanks to Sedef Kocakaplan Sezgin and with funding from TÜBITAK I had the opportunity to visit Türkiye and participate in several academic activities with included a series of talks at Bursa University of Technology and technical visits to historical sites as well as the premises of Fibrobeton - I have not seen such an eagerness to explore new frontiers and a devotion to research in a company for a while, kudos! The global challenge of earthquake risk reduction requires integrated efforts from all of us, academics, industry, communities and policymakers. We will do it! Oct 23 I was invited to give a presentation at Istanbul Technical University and visit Prof Alper Ilki ’s research group. I saw a very active lab exploring many seismic retrofitting techniques which are of course extremely important in the context of Turkey’s recent earthquake events. I as particularly interested in his work as main consultant for the repair works of Hagia Sophia , a structure very dear to my heart and one I have attempted analysing myself a few times.
